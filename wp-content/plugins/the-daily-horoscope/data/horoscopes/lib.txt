Pull your socks up! There is something that needs doing in your life that you have been putting off. It will only be more difficult the longer you wait to tackle it. Get it done, then enjoy the load being off your mind.
Try not to be too preoccupied with fairness. Everybody’s situation is different. Somebody else might be having more success than you at this moment but your time will come.
It’s decision time. Whatever you choose will be right for you at this time. Don’t worry too much about the repercussions. At the moment this decision is stopping you from moving forward.
Don’t be afraid to take some time to pamper yourself. You spend your life placating and pleasing others but there might be a slight tendency to forget about yourself in the process.
Have courage with your career. Don’t think twice about pursuing your dreams. Take that talent and passion of yours and make some money with it! There is no sense in making life harder than it is.
Be wary of somebody in your personal life trying to take advantage of your social nature. The need to be liked and to appease people could be harmful to you emotionally if you don’t control it.
An emotional storm rages within you. Try to keep a cool head and give that special person in your life a little space. The situation probably isn’t as bad as you think it is.
Take the time to really get to know yourself. You have spent your life adapting to the situation you are in and the people around you. Knowing who you really are will bring you peace.
Maybe it is time to give the partying and the social occasions a rest for now. Your resources are in danger of running out. Put your head down, get some work done, then reap the rewards.
Use your ability to see things from other people’s point of view to resolve a situation in your professional life. This is a great skill and you will go far in life with it.

The to do list is building up as we enter the holiday season. Try and get on top of it now so that you can enjoy the holidays when they do roll around.
Enjoy having your planet, Venus, in your sector this month. It will make you even more attractive to the opposite sex than you already are. Relish it!
Family and relationships are a big priority for you. This week, however, you need to prioritise work. After that you can come home and enjoy being with the people you love.
This is also the time of year when you might feel a little more fashion conscious. Hitting the shops and tweaking your look for 2016 should definitely be on the cards.

Enjoying the finer things is not a crime. The key now is to find a way to experience the finer things within your means. Create a financial plan so you know what you can afford to spend.
