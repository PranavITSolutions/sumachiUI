Let go of whatever you have been holding on to. The only person that is being harmed now is you. You can rest assured that the person who did you harm has totally forgotten about it.
Don’t worry too much about spending the money on that new piece of clothing you have your eye on. You work hard and are careful with your money. It’s ok to reward yourself for that.
Your ability to think your way around a situation is going to really stand to you some time this week. This will manifest as a positive development in your career.
Try not to resent your partner for organising your life for you. They are only trying to help. Even if they would have in fact been better leaving the planning to you, they are only trying to help.

If something is plaguing you in your personal life, explore it. The chances are your suspicions are true. Trust your intuition, it is a powerful tool.

Don’t be afraid to dream a little bigger! You are able for more than what you currently are. Leaving your safety zone and aiming higher will bring you inner fulfilment in the coming weeks.
Let your significant other go out without you every once in a while. Time apart is healthy and possessive or jealous behaviour will only drive them away.
It’s ok to take your foot off the gas. If you keep working as hard as you are the lovely festive experiences might pass you by.
Don’t take on more than you can handle with your friends. You are a great secret keeper and so your friends are inclined to dump on you, just make sure it’s not too much.

Something has been upsetting you for a very long time. Do whatever you need to to feel better as this pain is holding you in a dark place where you don’t want to be.
Enjoy treating yourself this Christmas. Take some of those hard earned savings and take a loved one on a mini break. You deserve to enjoy some of the money you work so hard for.
