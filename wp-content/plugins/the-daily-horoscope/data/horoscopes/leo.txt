Maybe think twice about that latest purchase. It may seem vital but will it in fact join the rest of the items that are now lying discarded in your house? Now is the time in your life for financial awareness.
Don’t be too proud to say what is bothering you. It may seem difficult for you to speak up if something is bothering you but you would feel better for it, and those around you will appreciate it.
Stay the course in your career. You thrive in the workplace and people look to you for the answers. If you treat your colleagues with respect you will quickly rise up to your rightful place at the top of the ladder.
Don’t rush into ending something because you fear the spark may be gone. Though this may be the end of the honeymoon phase, it is the start of something different, new and exciting.
Try not to take it personally when you feel people are giving you orders. If you swallow your pride you might actually learn something from that colleague who you only view as competition.
Be wary of turning something down based on your perception of what is second best. Something in your life which may not seem valuable or worthwhile might end up being what it truly important.
An event approaches for you where the temptation will be to lash out at someone you care about out of anger. Do your best to respond calmly or run the risk of damaging a worthwhile relationship.
Beware of treading on the toes of someone in a position of superiority. You are talented and charismatic but if you try to take too much too soon you may end up getting burned.
You might kick yourself for jumping into a relationship a little too soon just for something to do. Ask yourself whether the person is really special to you, or just providing you with entertainment.
Try to encourage somebody in your trust to express themselves more. As a Leo, you walk in the light and others can feel invisible. Appreciate your excellence as well as the virtue of others.
It has been a tough week and you have done an excellent job leading your pack. Treat yourself this weekend to a night out at the movies or the theatre.
Be mindful that you are not treading on your colleague’s toes. Your confidence is often interpreted as arrogance and this is not endearing. Just tone it down a little.
You look after yourself, which is great. This week try to look to others. Open up that big lion’s heart of yours. You can be extremely generous when you want to be.
Throw a party to celebrate the start of the holidays! You are excellent at having parties and hosting. Enjoy being the centre of attention and thriving in your home environment.
Using your sense of humour might be a good way for you to diffuse an issue that has been developing in your life. The ability to make people laugh is very powerful.
You naturally walk, or should I say prowl, in the light as a Leo. Let others share this light with you this weekend. They’ll really appreciate it and the good karma will come back to you.
Be mindful of your dominating behaviour in your professional life. A potential business partner won’t reach out to you if they feel too intimidated.
Allow yourself to nurture yourself and care for those around you as the holidays approach. Enjoy spending time with family and friends at this special time of year.
A loved one needs to have their moment in the sun. Listen to them and allow them to be the centre of attention. It is daunting trying to date a Leo!
Don’t settle for second best in your professional life. Though it might feel nice to be a big fish in a small pond it will serve you better to keep trying to climb the ladder.
