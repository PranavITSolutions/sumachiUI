You are an asset. Have confidence in yourself in your professional life. Your company really needs and relies on you. Never underestimate your value.
Don’t be afraid to take the plunge. There is a big decision in your life that you have been thinking about a lot of late. Don’t overthink it, just do it!
Have trust in that special person. They want you to open up to them emotionally. This may sound ridiculous to you but it will be difficult for your relationship to progress otherwise.
Try not to be too hard on yourself today. You will not be able to fix everything in life, brilliant as you are. For now try to relax and enjoy the ride and those problems will sort themselves out.
Your perfectionist personality is to be commended but in some instances maybe 99% perfect is ok. Whether you are over analysing your partner or your job, try to see the positives and not the negatives.
Today is a good day and good things are going to happen to you. Give into the good feelings you are experiencing and know that you deserve this happiness.
Be on the lookout today for someone who needs your help solving a problem. You will really make a difference in their life and the good deed will come back to you when you least expect it.
Try not to worry if somebody close to you doesn’t quite connect with your intellectual humour. You are a rare breed. It doesn’t mean that somebody else doesn’t have something else to contribute in their own way.
Denying that there is anything wrong is not going to solve the problem. Your loved ones care about you and can help you to deal with your troubles. They won’t seem nearly as big if you talk about them.
You have had difficulty sleeping well because of the countless things running around in your head. Consider meditation, hot drinks or other tools to help you sleep better. You’ll be no use to anyone otherwise.
This is always a difficult time of the year for you. Everything that needs to be done for the holidays threatens to overwhelm you. Just breathe, it’ll all be ok.
Give spontaneity a chance this Christmas. If your plans don’t work out precisely just go with the flow and see how magical it can be living in the moment.
You have been working very hard. A bit of R and R is required. Take a day off, turn off your phone do something that makes you happy.
Moving out of your comfort zone could lead to you having an exciting romantic encounter this week. Try going somewhere you normally wouldn’t for lunch or coffee.
Make sure you’re not just doing something because it is your routine. Re examine your life this week and make sure you are doing everything for the right reasons.
It’s time for you to step into the spotlight for once. You don’t always take the credit you deserve because of your modesty. Don’t let others take advantage of your nature.
Find a way to manage changes in your life so that you are comfortable with them. Design a new calendar or routine which will give you back your control.
Enjoy this new talkative and social mood which you find yourself in. Embrace the social interaction over the holiday period before the daily grind starts again.
Put yourself first, be selfish, pamper yourself. Now is the time for you. Improve yourself. Take up a new hobby and develop new skills.
Stop over-analysing. Your crush really does like you and is interested in you. Throw away that pros and cons list and jump in head first to this new and exciting venture.
