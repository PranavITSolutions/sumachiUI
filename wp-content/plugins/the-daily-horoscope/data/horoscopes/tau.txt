Maybe it’s time to make amends. Though it is difficult, swallowing your pride and reopening the lines of communication with the person you have had a disagreement with will stand to you.
Your perseverance is about to pay off. You have been working hard, and your hard work is not going unnoticed. Soon you will be rewarded for all that you do.
Make the move on your love interest. Though you may enjoy the slow and patient game, it is not for everybody and they may lose interest if something doesn’t happen soon.
Though your attention to detail is to be commended, it may be in danger of holding you back professionally if it causes work to move too slowly for your colleagues.
Your close friends may not show it, but they really do appreciate everything that you do for them. The little things which you do for them really do make the difference in their lives.
Don’t be afraid of change. Though you like what you know, something incredible may be just around the corner as long as you approach it with an open mind.
Express yourself. The people close to you can’t know what it going on in your life unless you tell them. If you let out what you have been bottling up a huge weight will be lifted from your shoulders.
Misunderstandings can destroy the most beautiful of relationships. They didn’t mean what they said. Try to forgive what was said and extend an olive branch, you’ll be glad you did.
Be perceptive to something different or exciting. You have a tendency to lose yourself in your routine and miss the more beautiful and unusual things happening in life.
Remain calm. Change is good. Try not to panic and let actions take their course. This could be the factor which gives you that career boost you have been working so hard for.
An unexpected change in your life is going to rock you to your core. Give this change time to marinade and settle, it might not be the worst thing after all.
Open your mind. You may be uncomfortable with certain realities of the world these days. Try to consider what it is like to be the people you are judging.
There is a project on your horizon which is going to fall to you to lead and to see through. When you do this you will be appreciated for the hard worker and the leader you are.
A fight could potentially break out between you and your loved one. Consider that this might be because of your stubborn behaviour and can be easily prevented.
You’re devoted to the people you love. The question does need to be asked however whether or not these people deserve your love.
Your patience is a virtue. Commitment to seeing a project through is something that is vitally important in life and you will reap the rewards of the work you put in.
A love interest is around the corner. This is going to be something carefree and fun. Don’t try and make this partner more than they are because of your sense of romance.
There is nothing wrong with being materialistic. Some people close to you can misinterpret your love of things for vanity. This is just misunderstanding so don’t be offended.
You have a tendency and see something through no matter what. You have started something recently which might not be right for you however and seeing it through may prove detrimental.
You enjoy hosting and chatting but when a close friend decides to throw a party you need to try to take a back seat so that they can have their deserved lime light.
